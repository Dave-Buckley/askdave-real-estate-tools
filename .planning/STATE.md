# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Make every agent faster at the tasks they repeat hundreds of times a week — calling, messaging, note-taking, and organizing — without touching the CRM or creating security concerns.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Core App + Communication

## Current Position

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 11 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Plan 01-02: Popup auto-dismisses after dial/whatsapp action; active number tracked in main process
- Plan 01-05: GitHub Releases as auto-update publish provider; notarize script skips when no credentials
- Plan 01-01: Used electron-store@9 (CJS) instead of v10+ ESM-only per research guidance
- Plan 01-01: Created project manually (electron-vite scaffold CLI requires interactive prompts)
- Project start: Cross-platform desktop (Windows + macOS) via Electron. Mobile covered by OneNote/Google Calendar apps in v1.
- Project start: Click-to-dial opens dialler with number pre-filled — does NOT auto-call
- Project start: Signable forms deferred to v3+ (legal complexity, separate web platform)
- Project start: Scrcpy/ADB dropped — phone-link integration used instead (no scary debugging)
- Project start: Simple instruction website only (v1 is desktop-focused)
- Project start: OAuth flows MUST use system browser redirect pattern — not embedded WebView (both Google and Microsoft block embedded WebView OAuth)
- Project start: Zero hidden costs — all APIs must have free tiers sufficient for v1

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: EV code-signing certificate must be ordered NOW — takes 1-3 weeks to procure. Do not wait until Phase 1 is complete.
- [Phase 2]: OAuth system browser redirect pattern in Electron is non-trivial for both Google and Microsoft simultaneously. Plan a 1-2 day spike before Phase 2 planning.
- [Phase 2]: OneNote page HTML content model is complex. Scope to append-only for MVP to reduce risk.
